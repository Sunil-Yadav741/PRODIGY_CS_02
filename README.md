# Task 1: Guessing Game Program
## Overview
- The Guessing Game is a simple C++ console application where the user tries to guess a number randomly selected by the program. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number, at which point the program displays the total number of attempts taken.

## Features
- Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number at the start of each game.
- User Feedback: After each guess, the program informs the user if the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- Attempt Counter: The program keeps track of the number of guesses made by the user and displays the total number of attempts when the correct guess is made.
- Replayability: After guessing the correct number, the program can be easily restarted for another round.

## Requirements
- C++
